## Client-Server Model with Socket Programming and AES-CBC Encryption

### Description
Developed a client-server model that uses Socket Programming, Inverted Index, and AES-CBC Encryption. 
This project enables clients to store data in encrypted form and retrieve it via keyword queries. 
It combines privacy and optimized searchability by allowing secure keyword searches within encrypted cloud-stored data.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Socket Programming** <sys/socket.h> ,<netinet/in.h> and <arpa/inet.h> 
- **AES-CBC Encryption** <openssl/evp.h> 

### Key Features
- **Data Security:** Utilizes AES-CBC encryption to ensure data privacy.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Implements an inverted index for optimized keyword searchability.
- **Client-Server Communication:** Uses socket programming to handle data transfer between client and server.

### How It Works
1. **Data Storage:** Clients can store their data (plain text files) on the server in encrypted form.
2. **Keyword Search:** Clients can retrieve their data by sending keyword queries to the server .
3. **Encrypted Communication:** Ensures that all data transfers between client and server are encrypted for security.

### Role
- Developed and implemented the entire client-server model.
- Integrated AES-CBC encryption for secure data storage and retrieval.
- Optimized searchability using an inverted index.

### Key Achievements
- Achieved secure and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Enabled keyword-based searches within encrypted data.
- Ensured data privacy while maintaining optimized searchability.
